Unlike a smartphone assistant, the r1 doesn't need app integrations or APIs; it learns how to use interfaces the way a human would. Designed by Teenage Engineering, the device features a distinctive orange plastic body with a scroll wheel, a 2.88-inch touchscreen, and a 360-degree rotating camera called the 'rabbit eye'. The r1 offloads all heavy computation to Rabbit's cloud, making it lightweight and low-power. It is aimed at users who want a dedicated AI companion without the distraction of a full smartphone.",

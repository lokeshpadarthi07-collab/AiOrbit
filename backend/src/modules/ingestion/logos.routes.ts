/**
 * Serves the logo bytes logoResolver.ts stores in R2. Mounted at the app
 * root as /logos/publishers, matching the path Publisher.logoUrl actually
 * stores (see PUBLIC_PATH_PREFIX in logoResolver.ts) — not nested under
 * /api/ingestion.
 *
 * Bundled-SVG logos (paths like /logos/openai.svg, no "publishers/"
 * segment — see sourceLogos.ts) are NOT served here. Those are a frontend
 * static-asset concern (the Next.js app's own public/logos/), unrelated to
 * R2 and unaffected by this route.

 * Publisher (news OUTLET) resolution and creation. Ported from the old

 * The Publisher is whoever wrote/published the article — its logo is
 * resolved and cached ONCE here, then reused by every future article from
 * that domain. The company mentioned in an article's title is never a logo
 * source.
 *
 * One deliberate difference from the old app: `prisma` is passed in rather
 * than imported as a module-level singleton, since this backend creates a
 * PrismaClient per request/invocation via the Neon adapter (see index.ts),
 * not a shared process-lifetime instance the way the old Next.js app could.
 *
 * resolveLogo() below takes a CloudinaryConfig — the real logo-download
 * tier (logoResolver.ts) uploads to Cloudinary rather than the old app's
 * local disk (or R2, which this replaced).

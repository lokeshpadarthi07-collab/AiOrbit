/**
 * Best-effort lookup against the Hugging Face Hub's public search API — no
 * auth required for reads. Only genuinely open-weight models (Llama,
 * Mistral, etc.) are hosted there at all — this is a fundamental ceiling,
 * not a matching-quality problem: proprietary API-only models (GPT-4,
 * Claude, Gemini) were never released as open weights, so no query or
 * matching logic will ever find them here. They correctly return null and
 * fall through to a different source (see fetchArenaScore below) rather
 * than this function trying harder. Never throws — a failed/timed-out
 * lookup just means "no real data available for this one," it doesn't
 * break the leaderboard.
 *
 * Matching requires the model name (most of it) to appear in a candidate's
 * HF id, AND either the creator or a distinctive word from the name itself
 * to appear in the candidate's org segment (see nameBrandInOrg below — real
 * orgs are sometimes the model's own brand, not the parent company, e.g.
 * Qwen models are hosted under org "Qwen", not "Alibaba"). Name alone isn't
 * enough: a short, generic name like "GPT-4" or "o1" will substring-match
 * some unrelated community repo (confirmed — an earlier, org-unchecked
 * version of this matched "GPT-4" to a real HF result that was obviously
 * not GPT-4). Also rejects a "match" whose downloads and likes are both
 * exactly 0 — a genuinely well-known open model on HF essentially always
 * has nonzero usage, so an all-zero result is a stronger signal of a bad
 * match than of a real-but-obscure one.

 * Real usage data for Tools that are published npm packages, keyed by the

 * random dev's redirect script ("This is not the official Claude Code
 * package"), "cursor" is an unrelated buffer utility, "gemini" is a
 * screenshot-testing tool, "jasper" a template engine, "otter" a server
 * framework. npm's flat, unscoped namespace lets anyone register a short
 * consumer-brand word, so slug match alone produced ~37/116 false-positive
 * "matches" in testing before this guard was added. To trust a package's
 * download numbers as a tool's real usage data, its registry metadata
 * (homepage/repository/bugs URL) must reference the tool's own website
 * domain — the same "verify before trusting an exact-match API" lesson
 * the Hugging Face integration already applies via token/popularity
 * checks, adapted to npm's different (namespace-collision, not
 * fuzzy-search) failure mode. This tightened bar means it now covers only
 * a small slice of Tools (most AI products here are closed SaaS with no
 * npm package at all, official or otherwise), but every match it does
 * return is genuinely the tool's own package.
 *
 * Uses the downloads range endpoint (30 days of real daily counts) rather
 * than the simpler point endpoint specifically to compute a genuine
 * week-over-week growth percentage — a single downloads-this-week number
 * is a snapshot, not a trend, same limitation the Models integration has
 * for GitHub-style star counts. npm's range endpoint conveniently makes a
 * real trend computable from ONE request, no historical snapshot storage
 * needed.

 * *of* the tool's own site, not just a story that happens to mention its
 * name.
 *
 * Real domain-matched HN mentions for a single product in a single week
 * are typically zero or one, even for well-known tools — a week-over-week
 * percentage computed on that few data points is noise (0→1 reads as
